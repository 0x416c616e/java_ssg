# java_ssg

A static site generator written in Java. I'm using this for the blog portion of my website, [chicagolandsoftware.com](https://chicagolandsoftware.com). It's an alternative to a content management system.

You could possibly use it for a different site, but I made this specifically for generating static pages for my own site.

It takes XML article files and combines them with HTML templates. The two templates are for the blog post list (just titles and links), and the specific blog posts, which contain everything.
